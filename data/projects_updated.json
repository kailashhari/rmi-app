In this gait, the robot is in static equilibrium throughout its motion. Mechanisms such as parallelogram linkages, belts and gear drives were developed to actuate the 2 DOF joints at the ankle and hip. The fabrication of the real-life prototype based on the simulation results is completed. Currently, we are developing the trajectories for the gait of the bipedal robot."
